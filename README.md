## SKY JUMP 

The game consists of an adaptation of SKY JUMP from Pou. 

The goal is to reach as high as possible, jumping from platform to platform. 

Along the way, rewards (coins) are collected that increase the score.There are also enemies that go from side to side, whose contact results in the reduction of one in the player's health.

The game ends with the player's arrival at the highest level. The player loses if either falls on the ground or reaches null health.

It's developed in a vertical screen that goes up with the evolution of the game. As time goes by the screen starts to scroll down faster, in order to increase the difficulty of the game and this speed will increase from time to time reaching the end at it's highest speed.

The player moves to the left using the A key, moves up (jumps up) using the W key and moves right using the D key. It will jump left if the combination of W key is followed by A key and it will jump right if the combination of W key followed D key is pressed.

Instructions can be checked on the main menu.
